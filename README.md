# AlgorithmProject(CS 5329 – Programming Project – Group 1)
Median finding, Order Statistics and Quick Sort

Overview:
   The purpose of the project is to compare the performance of QuickSort Algorithm, by using various pivot supply strategies.
   
Implementation:
   1. Finished Iterative version of Median Of Medians.
   2. Quick Select Algorithm which uses Median Of Median for pivot supply.
   3. Random Select Algorithm which uses Random element as pivot.
   4. Implement Three versions of quick sort algorithm which uses all the above algorithms to supply pivot.
   5. Implement Random Quicksort and Normal Quiksort.
   6. Write test functions to test all algorithms, write time and input size to files.
   7. Plot the graphs using input size and execution time to compare performance.
   
Working:
   step 1: Add all the header files and source files to your project in code blocks.
   step 2: Add main.cpp file, compile and execute the program.
   step 3: select any of 3 options to compare or 0 to exit.
